# Codelab 2 Final Project: Harry Potter Program
This repository contains my final project for Codelab 2, where I utilized OpenFrameworks and an API to create an interactive Harry Potter application. The program allows users to explore and view details about various potions and spells from the Harry Potter universe.

## Features:
- **Potion Viewer**: Browse and learn about different magical potions.
- **Spell Book**: Discover a range of spells with their descriptions and effects.
- **Favorites**: Save and view descriptions of your favorite spells and potions.

  
## Technologies Used:
- **OpenFrameworks**: For creating the graphical user interface and handling interactions.
- **API Integration**: To fetch and display data about potions and spells using [PotterDB](https://potterdb.com/).
